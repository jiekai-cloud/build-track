/*
    Google Sheet Data Extractor & Parser
    
    This script processes the raw CSV data extracted from the Google Sheet and converts it into
    structured TypeScript objects suitable for the Quotation System's preset templates.
    
    Data Source:
    General Quotation, Spider Man, No Destructive Toilet, Destructive Toilet, SPC Toilet,
    Designer Items, Ventilation Method, Inorganic Waterproofing, Wall Cancer, Basement
*/

/* 
   NOTE: I have the raw CSV strings from the browser_subagent's memory (step 32).
   I will manually clean and structure them into the `quotationPresets.ts` file.
   
   Structure for each item:
   {
       id: string,
       description: string,
       unit: string,
       quantity: number,
       unitPrice: number,
       total: number,
       discount: 0,
       isCustom: boolean
   }
*/

// I will now overwrite `data/quotationPresets.ts` with the fully populated data.
// Since the data is massive (10 sheets, ~100+ items), I will implement a parser logic 
// within my own context and generate the final file content directly.
